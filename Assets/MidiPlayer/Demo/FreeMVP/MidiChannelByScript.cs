    /// <summary>@brief
    /// This Minimum Viable Product focuses on the essentials of a Maestro feature. 
    /// Only a few functions are presented. Links to the documentation are provided for further exploration.
    /// As a result, error handling is intentionally minimal, the user interface is lightweight, and Unity setup is reduced. 
    /// 
    /// The goal is to learn how to use the Maestro API, then progress by building more complex applications.
    /// Maestro is based on prefabs (MidiFilePlayer, MidiStreamPlayer, ...) that must be added to your Unity scene hierarchy.
    /// In these demos, prefabs are created by script to reduce editor manipulations. 
    /// In production, it is recommended to create prefabs in the Unity Editor to take advantage of the Inspector and its many accessible parameters.
    /// 
    /// Functionality Demonstrated:
    /// - Enable or disable channels when a MIDI is playing. 
    /// - Keep only the drum channel playing.
    ///
    /// How to Use:
    /// 1. Add an empty GameObject to your Unity Scene and attach this script to the GameObject.
    /// 2. Add a MidiFilePlayer prefab to your scene (right click on the Hierarchy Tab, menu Maestro)
    /// 3. Run the scene and change the value of OnlyDrum in the inspector
    /// 
    /// Documentation References:
    /// - MIDI File Player: https://paxstellar.fr/midi-file-player-detailed-view-2/
    /// - MPTKChannel: https://mptkapi.paxstellar.com/da/dc1/class_midi_player_t_k_1_1_m_p_t_k_channel.html
