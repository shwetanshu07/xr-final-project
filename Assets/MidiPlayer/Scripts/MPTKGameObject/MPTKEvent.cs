    /// <summary>@brief
    /// Represents a MIDI event used throughout MPTK.
    /// This class is central to script-based MIDI workflows in components such as
    /// MidiStreamPlayer, MidiFilePlayer, MidiFileLoader, and MPTKWriter.
    ///
    /// The key property is Command. The meaning of other fields (for example Value)
    /// depends on the selected MIDI command type.
    ///
    /// Typical use cases:
    /// - play/stop notes,
    /// - change instrument (patch/preset),
    /// - send control changes,
    /// - handle meta events.
    ///
    /// Related components:
    /// - MidiFileLoader: reads MIDI events from files,
    /// - MidiFilePlayer: processes MIDI events from the internal sequencer,
    /// - MPTKWriter: generates MIDI content programmatically,
    /// - MidiStreamPlayer: plays MIDI events in real time.
    ///
